## This is my first project using purely only HTML and CSS. 

I have made a basic testimonial grid to polish and implement all the things I have learned till now. This project website is a responsive layout of CSS Grid.

## Concepts/Languages Used
--> HTML
--> CSS
--> CSS Grid
--> CSS Flexbox 

## Things learned from this project.

I have learned how to make css grid-layout and displaying content correctly in Grid elements using the flexbox to create gaps or spaces in between. I learned how the nesting of flexbox works in a Grid element. For smaller width devices I have displayed grid as an flex-group so that it is easily visible for the small device-width devices.

I know my code will look little bit hecky and less logical but I will try to improve it day by day.
